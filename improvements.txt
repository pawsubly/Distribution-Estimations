Check back on this file before Project 2 (and as I finish Project 1 on my own over time)
- Push on Github FREQUENTLY. Don't dump massive amounts of info, refine smaller amounts and push quality.
- Remember all the things learned about numpy, pandas, seaborn, and Python in general (colon splicer and array manipulation mostly)
- Allocate 2 hours of debugging per 1 hour of coding
- SOURCE BETTER. Document every article, video, any resource that helped you understand better. It's not for academic integrity (which is a given), but for resource backtracking in the far future when your mind will long forget about these things and be working on different subjects.
